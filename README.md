# Bustrackermap
Map animation between two bus stops in Boulder, CO. I used mapbox.com to create a map and used a map marker to shows the bus stops between the downtown bus station
and Table Mesa Blvd. 
## How to Run
Click the top left button to show the bus stops between the downtown bus station in Boulder and Table Mesa Blvd also in Boulder.
### Future improvements
For future improvments, I'd like to see light rail stops in Denver or subway stops in Chicago. Data including latitude/longitude for stops in these cities would be required.
